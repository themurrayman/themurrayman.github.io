        <h3>Explore</h3>
        <p>Today you can be guided up the 115 well worn spiral steps of the tower and explore the thick walled chamber, with each ascending step trail the daily and nightly ritual of every light keeper who served at Hook Lighthouse.</p>

        <p>Journey through the ages of the world’s oldest working lighthouse and learn the tales and fascinating stories of those who spent their lives watching over the safety of those at sea from your first meeting with the life-sized hologram figure of St. Dubhan, who tells of perishing nights spent with his fellow monks in the 5th century warning sailors against the dangers with a beacon they kept alight on the headland.</p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>The tapering headland of Hook Head, located in the south-western corner of county Wexford, forms the eastern boundary of the great estuary known as Waterford Harbour. The headland is sometimes called a peninsula which means “almost an island”.</p>
        <p>Because of the rivers Barrow, Nore and Suir which flow into the estuary it was known in Irish as Comar na dtrí nUisce (the confluence of three waters).

        <h3>Traffic</h3>
        <p>The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is an automated tracking system used on ships and by Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) for identifying and locating vessels by electronically exchanging data with other nearby ships and VTS stations.</p>

        <p>The International Maritime Organization‘s (IMO) International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) requires AIS to be fitted aboard international voyaging ships with gross tonnage (GT) of 300 or more tons, and all passenger ships regardless of size.</p>

        <h3>Conservation</h3>
        <p>Species, habitats and ecosystems, are under an ever-increasing threat. Many species and habitats are in decline and in some cases their future is endangered.</p>

        <p>Undoubtedly human behaviour now causes, directly and indirectly, considerable loss of biological diversity. In Ireland today, habitat degradation and loss is the main factor eroding biodiversity.</p>
